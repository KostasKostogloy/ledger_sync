LedgerSync has now grown to support three different ledgers!  As LedgerSync grows, we want to ensure the library is easy
to use and understand.  Our README was growing quite unwieldy, so we decided to generate this static website.

These docs contain a mix of manually and automatically generated content.  We have developed scripts that keep our
docs in sync with the code.  Our goal is to reduce the need to write documentation with each commit.

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/LedgerSync/ledger_sync/issues/new).
